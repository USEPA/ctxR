This assay endpoint, NVS_LGIC_rGABAR_NonSelective, was analyzed in the positive analysis fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. \r\nUsing a type of binding reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the binding as they relate to the gene Gabra1. \r\nFurthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a primary readout, because the performed assay has only produced 1 assay endpoint. \r\nTo generalize the intended target to other relatable targets, this assay endpoint is annotated to the ion channel intended target family, where the subfamily is ligand-gated ion channel.",
