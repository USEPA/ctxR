    "assayComponentEndpointDesc": "Data from the assay component TOX21_AR_BLA_Agonist_ch1 was analyzed into 1 assay endpoint. This assay endpoint, TOX21_AR_BLA_Agonist_ch1, was analyzed in the positive analysis fitting direction relative to DMSO as the negative control and baseline of activity. Using a type of inducible reporter, loss-of-signal activity can be used to understand changes in the reporter gene as they relate to the gene AR. Furthermore, this assay endpoint can be referred to as a secondary readout, because this assay has produced multiple assay endpoints where this one serves as artifact detection function.",
