The CHEMINV file includes all chemical samples procured by Evotec for possible inclusion in EPA's ToxCast program since the start of the program in 2007, as well as a relatively small set of donated or EPA-supplied samples that were shipped to Evotec to be included in EPA's physical sample library. The list includes all samples received and registered by Evotec, but all samples were not necessarily solubilized or plated for testing, i.e., the full list includes volatiles, DMSO insolubles, depleted chemicals, and discarded chemicals deemed too dangerous for storage and handling.  All physical samples plated for screening in the ToxCast program (TOXCAST), which includes EPA's full contribution to the Tox21 screening program (TOX21SL), are included as a subset of CHEMINV, as is the full list of samples currently available for ToxCast plating. Hence, the CHEMINV inventory file is a snapshot of all past and present samples. The CHEMINV file provides a complete historical record of chemicals that were prioritized for inclusion in EPA's ToxCast and Tox21 screening programs based on multiple criteria (toxicity data, exposure potential, use, etc.), and that were successfully procured by (or provided to) EPA's ToxCast Chemical Contractor (Evotec) for possible inclusion in those programs. The CHEMINV file is a subset of EPA's ChemTrack database (CHEMTRACK), the latter including all chemicals for which ToxCast or Tox21 screening data have been generated. CHEMTRACK additionally includes reference chemicals for which data were provided by ToxCast collaborators, as well as Tox21 chemicals not in EPA's physical inventory that were separately provided by Tox21 federal testing partners (the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences). A detailed description of EPA's chemical management system and the DSSTox curation associated with chemical registration and mapping of the CHEMINV file is provided in the published document available for download at:\r\n<a href='https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxcast-chemicals-data-management-and-quality-considerations-overview' target='_blank'>https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxcast-chemicals-data-management-and-quality-considerations-overview<\/a>\r\nFor more information on EPA’s ToxCast program, see:\r\n<a href='https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecasting' target='_blank'>https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecasting<\/a>\r\nhttps://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecasting",

EPA researchers developed the EDSP Universe of Chemicals Dashboard to provide access to chemical data on over 1,800 chemicals of interest.\r\nThe purpose of the EDSP Dashboard is to help the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program evaluate chemicals for endocrine-related activity. The data for this version of the Dashboard comes from various sources:<br/><br/>\r\n•\tRapid, automated (or in vitro high-throughput) chemical screening data generated by the EPA’s Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) project and the federal Toxicity Testing in the 21st century (Tox21) collaboration.<br/>\r\n•\tChemical exposure data and prediction models (ExpoCastDB).<br/>\r\n•\tHigh quality chemical structures and annotations (DSSTox).<br/>\r\n•\tPhyschem Properties Database (PhysChemDB).<br/><br/>\r\nThe Dashboard displays bioassay information, bioactivity concentrations, estrogen and androgen receptor (ER and AR) model results, predicted physicochemical properties, and more. Current chemical and bioassay data can be accessed at <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\">https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecaster-toxcasttm-data\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecaster-toxcasttm-data<\/a> .

There are many factors that determine whether a chemical will cause a specific adverse health outcome. Careful review is required to determine the use of the data in a particular decision context.<br/>\r\n•\tInterpretation of ToxCast data is expected to change over time as both the science and analytical methods improve.<br/>\r\n•\tAdditional substances that are not part of the EDSP’s statutory authority are included since they are relevant to EPA’s ongoing work on the validation of the endocrine and androgen bioactivity models.<br/><br/>\r\nEPA will continuously update chemicals on the EDSP Dashboard to include as much relevant information on chemicals in the EDSP <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/endocrine-disruptor-screening-program-edsp-universe-chemicals\" target=\"_blank\">Universe of Chemicals<\/a> as possible. Some “EDSP Universe of Chemicals” do not have bioactivity information in the EDSP Dashboard because of the incompatibility of some chemicals to be tested in ToxCast (e.g., chemical too volatile, chemical not soluble in DMSO, etc.). <br/><br/>\r\nThe <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/edspuoc\" target=\"_blank\">list of the EDSP Universe of Chemicals<\/a> contains approximately 10,000 chemicals, as defined under FFDCA and SDWA 1996 amendments. \r\nThe Agency has also added test data on as many chemicals as possible to the EDSP Dashboard that were on <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-first-list-chemicals-tier-1-screening-under-endocrine-disruptor\" target=\"_blank\">EDSP List 1<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/overview-second-list-chemicals-tier-1-screening-under-endocrine-disruptor\" target=\"_blank\">EDSP List 2<\/a>:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/edsp21list1\" target=\"_blank\">EDSP List 1<\/a>: The list of chemicals for initial EDSP Tier 1 Screening under the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program includes chemicals that the Agency, in its discretion, decided should be tested first, based upon exposure potential.

        "longDescription": "The EPA Fathead Minnow Acute Toxicity database was generated by the U.S. EPA Mid-Continental Ecology Division (MED) for the purpose of developing an expert system to predict acute toxicity from chemical structure based on mode of action considerations. Hence, an important and unusual characteristic of this toxicity database is that the 617 tested industrial organic chemicals were expressly chosen to serve as a useful training set for development of predictive quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). A second valuable aspect of this database, from a QSAR modeling perspective, is the inclusion of general mode-of-action (MOA) classifications of acute toxicity response for individual chemicals derived from study results. These MOA assignments are biologically based classifications, allowing definition of chemical similarity based upon biological activity instead of organic chemistry functional class as most commonly employed in QSAR study. MOA classifications should strengthen the scientific basis for construction of individual QSARs. However, it is cautioned that the broad MOA categorizations should not be construed to represent a single molecular mechanism; for example, CNS seizure agents and respiratory inhibitors are known to act through a variety of receptors. The DSSTox EPAFHM database includes information pertaining to organic chemical class assignments (ChemClass_FHM), acute toxicity in fathead minnow (LC50_mg), dose-response assessments (LC50_Ratio, ExcessToxicityIndex), behavioral assessments (FishBehaviorTest), joint toxicity MOA evaluations of mixtures (MOA_MixtureTest), and additional MOA evaluation of fish acute toxicity syndrome (FishAcuteToxSyndrome) in rainbow trout. All of these indicators, to the extent available, were considered in the determination of MOA and, additionally, were used to determine a level of confidence in the MOA assignment for each chemical (MOA_Confidence).

EPA developed the NATA as a state-of-the-science screening tool for State/Local/Tribal Agencies to prioritize pollutants, emission sources and locations of interest for further study in order to gain a better understanding of risks.  NATA assessments do not incorporate refined information about emission sources but, rather, use general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts than underestimate them.\r\n\r\nNATA provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from breathing (inhaling) air toxics in order to inform both national and more localized efforts to identify and prioritize air toxics, emission source types and locations which are of greatest potential concern in terms of contributing to population risk.  This in turn helps air pollution experts focus limited analytical resources on areas and or populations where the potential for health risks are highest.  Assessments include estimates of cancer and non-cancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources, including assessments of non-cancer health effects for Diesel Particulate Matter (PM). Assessments provide a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged.",

The third party profiler submits a report to Safer Choice, with a recommendation on whether the chemical passes the Criteria for Safer Chemical Ingredients. Safer Choice staff performs due diligence by reviewing the submission for completeness, consistency, and compliance with the Safer Choice Criteria. If more than one third-party has evaluated the chemical, Safer Choice also checks for differences in the profiles and resolves any conflicts. In some cases, Safer Choice may also perform additional literature reviews and consider data from confidential sources, such as EPA's New Chemicals Program. Safer Choice does not typically examine primary literature (original studies) as part of its review and listing decisions.\r\nThe list is not intended to be exclusive. Chemicals may be submitted as part of a formulation that the program has yet to review or a chemical manufacturer may develop a chemical to meet the Safer Choice criteria. If these chemicals meet our criteria, they may be approved for use in Safer Choice-labeled products and added to the SCIL.

        "longDescription": "TOX21SL is a list of unique DSSTox substances comprising the original screening library for the Tox21 program, a multi-federal agency collaborative among US EPA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Toxicology Program (NTP) and National Center for Advances in Translational Science (NCATS), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). EPA, NTP and NCATS partners contributed approximately equal size inventories to the library, whereas FDA contributed a small set of drugs. EPA’s contribution to the original TOX21SL fully covered its ToxCast inventory, so retains significant overlap with the current ToxCast HTS inventory (<a href=https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/toxcast”target=”_blank”>TOXCAST<\/a>). The NTP contribution was drawn from the NTP bioassay and research testing programs of chemicals of interest to environmental toxicology, and the NCATS contribution consisted primarily of marketed drugs. Tox21 compounds were selected based on a wide range of criteria, including, but not limited to: environmental hazard or exposure concern based on production volume (industrial chemicals) or occurrence data, availability of animal toxicity study data, food-additives, fragrances, toxicity reference chemicals, and drugs or known bioactive compounds. Chemicals in the original Tox21 program underwent screening at the intramural NCATS robotics testing facility. All HTS assay data generated in association with the Tox21 program are publicly available through PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), as are the analytical chemistry quality control (QC) summary records generated in association with the Tox21 testing program. Tox21 assay data are also included in EPA’s ToxCast data downloads (<a href='https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/exploring-toxcast-data-downloadable-data' target='_blank'>https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/exploring-toxcast-data-downloadable-data)<\/a>.<br/><br/>For current information on the Tox21 program, see \r\n<a href='https://tox21.gov/page/home' target='_blank'>https://tox21.gov/page/home<\/a><br/><br/>\r\nUpdate (Nov 20, 2018):<br/><br/>The following publication coauthored by Tox21 Federal Partner Leads lays out a strategic and operational plan for the Tox21 program from 2018 onward:  <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529324' target='_blank'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529324)<\/a><br>  \r\nThe plan articulates areas of focused scientific investment, both in chemical and biological space, to which new Tox21 cross-partner projects will be directed. In keeping with the new strategic plan, the Tox21 testing library moving forward is being consolidated under EPA chemical management and includes the full, currently available EPA ToxCast chemical library as well as approx. 1300 newly added chemicals provided by the NTP that were in the original TOX21SL library. The full chemical library available to the Tox21 cross-partner projects as DMSO solutions currently exceeds 6400 chemicals, of which nearly 6000 were included in the original TOX21SL library.

The criteria focused on chemicals that meet one or more of the following factors:\r\n\r\nPotentially of concern to children’s health (for example, because of reproductive or developmental effects)\r\n\r\nNeurotoxic effects\r\nPersistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic (PBT)\r\nProbable or known carcinogens\r\nUsed in children’s products\r\nDetected in biomonitoring programs\r\n\r\nUsing this process, EPA in 2012 identified  chemicals in the TSCA Work Plan as candidates for assessment over the next several years, as they all scored high in this screening process based on their combined hazard, exposure, and persistence and bioaccumulation characteristics. In 2014, using new information submitted to the Agency, EPA updated the TSCA Work Plan.",
