The CHEMINV file includes all chemical samples procured by Evotec for possible inclusion in EPA's ToxCast program since the start of the program in 2007, as well as a relatively small set of donated or EPA-supplied samples that were shipped to Evotec to be included in EPA's physical sample library. The list includes all samples received and registered by Evotec, but all samples were not necessarily solubilized or plated for testing, i.e., the full list includes volatiles, DMSO insolubles, depleted chemicals, and discarded chemicals deemed too dangerous for storage and handling.  All physical samples plated for screening in the ToxCast program (TOXCAST), which includes EPA's full contribution to the Tox21 screening program (TOX21SL), are included as a subset of CHEMINV, as is the full list of samples currently available for ToxCast plating. Hence, the CHEMINV inventory file is a snapshot of all past and present samples. The CHEMINV file provides a complete historical record of chemicals that were prioritized for inclusion in EPA's ToxCast and Tox21 screening programs based on multiple criteria (toxicity data, exposure potential, use, etc.), and that were successfully procured by (or provided to) EPA's ToxCast Chemical Contractor (Evotec) for possible inclusion in those programs. The CHEMINV file is a subset of EPA's ChemTrack database (CHEMTRACK), the latter including all chemicals for which ToxCast or Tox21 screening data have been generated. CHEMTRACK additionally includes reference chemicals for which data were provided by ToxCast collaborators, as well as Tox21 chemicals not in EPA's physical inventory that were separately provided by Tox21 federal testing partners (the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences).

EPACHEMINV_AVAIL includes EPA’s previous ToxCast inventory (a subset of (<a href='https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/toxcast' target='_blank'>TOXCAST<\/a>) as well as approximately 1300 chemicals donated by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) as part of the Tox21 chemical library consolidation effort. This recently added NTP set represents the full portion of NTP’s original contribution to the Tox21 library (<a href='https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/tox21sl' target='_blank'>TOX21SL<\/a>) that was deemed to be non-overlapping with EPA’s current ToxCast library.  <br/> <br/> \r\nOf the total unique chemicals in EPACHEMINV_AVAIL, approximately 6000 were included in the original TOX21SL library (70% of the total), with the remainder in EPACHEMINV_AVAIL resulting from the continuous expansion of EPA’s ToxCast library. The remaining Tox21 chemicals not included in EPACHEMINV were either discontinued or were drugs originally contributed by the Tox21 NCATS (National Center for Advances in Translational Science) partner; future expansion of EPACHEMINV_AVAIL may include newly procured drugs provided by NCATS. Hence, in addition to supplying new ToxCast projects, EPACHEMINV_AVAIL is intended to serve as the new, consolidated TOX21 library moving forward, as outlined in the recently published Tox21 strategic and operational planning document (available at <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529324') target='_blank'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529324)<\/a>.

        "TOX21SL is list of unique substances comprising the screening library for the Tox21 program, a multi-federal agency collaborative among the US EPA, NIH/NTP, NIH/NCATS, and the US FDA.",
        "TOX21SL is a list of unique DSSTox substances comprising the original screening library for the Tox21 program, a multi-federal agency collaborative among US EPA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Toxicology Program (NTP) and National Center for Advances in Translational Science (NCATS), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). EPA, NTP and NCATS partners contributed approximately equal size inventories to the library, whereas FDA contributed a small set of drugs. EPA’s contribution to the original TOX21SL fully covered its ToxCast inventory, so retains significant overlap with the current ToxCast HTS inventory (<a href=https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/toxcast”target=”_blank”>TOXCAST<\/a>). The NTP contribution was drawn from the NTP bioassay and research testing programs of chemicals of interest to environmental toxicology, and the NCATS contribution consisted primarily of marketed drugs. Tox21 compounds were selected based on a wide range of criteria, including, but not limited to: environmental hazard or exposure concern based on production volume (industrial chemicals) or occurrence data, availability of animal toxicity study data, food-additives, fragrances, toxicity reference chemicals, and drugs or known bioactive compounds. Chemicals in the original Tox21 program underwent screening at the intramural NCATS robotics testing facility. All HTS assay data generated in association with the Tox21 program are publicly available through PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), as are the analytical chemistry quality control (QC) summary records generated in association with the Tox21 testing program. Tox21 assay data are also included in EPA’s ToxCast data downloads (<a href='https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/exploring-toxcast-data-downloadable-data' target='_blank'>https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/exploring-toxcast-data-downloadable-data)<\/a>.<br/><br/>For current information on the Tox21 program, see \r\n<a href='https://tox21.gov/page/home' target='_blank'>https://tox21.gov/page/home<\/a><br/><br/>\r\nUpdate (Nov 20, 2018):<br/><br/>The following publication coauthored by Tox21 Federal Partner Leads lays out a strategic and operational plan for the Tox21 program from 2018 onward:  <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529324' target='_blank'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29529324)<\/a><br>  \r\nThe plan articulates areas of focused scientific investment, both in chemical and biological space, to which new Tox21 cross-partner projects will be directed. In keeping with the new strategic plan, the Tox21 testing library moving forward is being consolidated under EPA chemical management and includes the full, currently available EPA ToxCast chemical library as well as approx. 1300 newly added chemicals provided by the NTP that were in the original TOX21SL library. The full chemical library available to the Tox21 cross-partner projects as DMSO solutions currently exceeds 6400 chemicals, of which nearly 6000 were included in the original TOX21SL library.

In the publication “Revisiting Five Years of CASMI Contests with EPA Identification Tools” by McEachran et al, compound identification was performed on all 5 CASMI contest datasets using Dashboard tools and data in order to critically evaluate Dashboard performance relative to that of other applications. CASMI data were accessed via <a href='http://casmi-contest.org/' target='_blank'>http://casmi-contest.org/<\/a> and processed for use in our spectral matching and identification workflow. We conducted an in-depth review of the CASMI structure sets which sometimes resulted in edits to structures as described in the publication and we are providing these edited datasets via the Dashboard as reference data. This is the CASMI2014 dataset.",

        "CERAPP (Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project) is a large-scale modeling project demonstrate the efficacy of using predictive computational models trained on high-throughput screening data to evaluate thousands of chemicals for ER-related activity and prioritize them for further testing. CERAPP combined multiple models developed in collaboration with 17 groups in the United States and Europe to predict ER activity of a common set of 32,464 chemical structures. Quantitative structure–activity relationship models and docking approaches were employed, mostly using a common training set of 1,677 chemical structures provided by the U.S. EPA, to build a total of 40 categorical and 8 continuous models for binding, agonist, and antagonist ER activity. All predictions were evaluated on a set of 7,522 chemicals curated from the literature. To overcome the limitations of single models, a consensus was built by weighting models on scores based on their evaluated accuracies.
